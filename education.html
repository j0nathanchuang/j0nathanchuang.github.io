            <p>
              At the University of Michigan, I pursued a major in Computer 
              Science and a minor in Spanish, immersing myself in a diverse 
              array of courses that challenged me to think critically and 
              adapt to new perspectives. I completed my Bachelor's of Science 
              degree in May of 2022. My academic experience was complemented 
              by extracurriculars, including serving as a practice player for 
              the Michigan Women’s Basketball team, president of Wolverine 
              Sports Analytics, and media chair for Hoops for Hope.

                  <p>
                    A major aspect I missed from high school was going to basketball 
                    practice every day after school ended. The routine kept me in shape
                    and allowed me to make some of my closest friends to this day.
                    <br />
                    At Michigan, I was fortunate enough to be a practice player for
                    women's basketball team, which fulfilled that nostalgia. 
                    Furthermore, it was such a cool experience to be able to play with
                    incredibily talented female basketball players, some of which ended
                    up going on to play professionally.
                    <br />
                    As a practice player, we would do drills and scrimmages with the team.
                    Once the season started, we would also play as the upcoming opposing team's 
                    players so the team could get a feel for how they would play against them.
                    <br />
                    This was truly a once-in-a-lifetime experience and I am so grateful 
                    I got to experience basketball at the highest collegiate level.

                      I joined this club my freshman year because I love
                      basketball and wanted to volunteer in the community.
                      Through numerous semesters of hosting basketball clinics for the
                      elementary school kids at Central Academy, I realized that
                      this club is more about mentorship and the sense of
                      community for these kids than it is about basketball. As the
                      media chair, I created the club's
                      <a target="_blank" href="https://michiganhoopsforhope.com/"
                        >website</a
                      >
                      and handled the club's social media pages on Instagram and
                      LinkedIn. But more importantly, as a mentor, I've built
                      lasting relationships with these young kids and, hopefully,
                      ingrained the importance of exercising instead of making
                      TikToks.

                  Everyone should absolutely take this class. This course was my
                  first exposure to coding and also, it was the course that
                  convinced me to be a computer science major<span id="dots1"
                    >...</span
                  ><span class="more" id="more1"
                    >. Now, I am not saying that it will have the same effect on
                    you too, however, I am saying that coding and understanding
                    the basics of computer science will play a huge role in the
                    near future, regardless of your occupation. If you do not have
                    coding experience prior to college, like me, you will probably
                    find this course to be a challenging and time consuming
                    course. But utlimately, I found that these challenges and the
                    way coding taught me a new way of thinking is what I like so
                    much about computer science. Hopefully, you will too. </span

                  Personally, I thought this was a much more difficult course than
                  advertised because the professor's teaching style did not match

                    was a brilliant researcher and knew R extremely well, however,
                    I had difficulty understanding her lectures because she would
                    blindly lecture without checking for student understanding or
                    go through practice examples together in class. I found going
                    to GSI office hours very helpful to get a more detailed
                    understanding of the material and to finish the homeworks
                    correctly. On a positive note, I learned R in this course and
                    decided not to be a statistics major. </span

                    "Speaking Math" section of 125 focuses on how publication
                    incorporate and manipulate statistics to convey the message
                    they want. Almost always, the statistics are factual, however,
                    it's important to ask yourself how they got these statistics
                    and from who & how the portrayal of numbers could lead to a
                    different reaction if they were shown in a different form (i.e
                    90% are good vs. 10% are bad). </span

                  I really wish I had taken this course further into my college
                  career. This was a fun course where
                  <span id="dots4">...</span
                  ><span class="more" id="more4">
                    everyone was split into small groups (4-6) and each group had
                    half-a-semester to turn an idea into reality on an issue
                    that's important to the group members. Our group ended up
                    creating a project that matched people who were looking for
                    workout partners to promote exercise because we all believed
                    that people have a tendency to remove exercise from their
                    schedules when their work schedule gets busy. The struggle is
                    real. As someone who skips leg day every now and then, I know
                    if I had a workout partner every time I went to the gym, I
                    would feel motivated and obligated to do every leg day. As I
                    said, I wish I had taken this course later because now I have
                    much more ideas and a wider skillset to transform my ideas

                    towards testing and debugging but it also advanced my
                    knowledge and enjoyment in computer science exponentially. As
                    the course name implies, I learned many new data structures I

                    programming, branch and bound, new sorting algorithms,
                    depth-first search, and breadth-first search. While the rumor

                    it is equally rewarding in hindsight. </span

                  I registered for this class because of a friend's recommendation

                    relevant topic every week through only one lecture and one
                    homework each week. In my prior EECS courses, they provide us
                    with the tools and tell us how to use it for our specific
                    purposes. For example, for projects, I would get
                    instructor-made Makefiles and all I had to do was to type
                    "make project" in terminal and "magic" would happen. However,
                    EECS 201 dives into what these tools are, how we can build our
                    own tools, and why these tools are used. Some of my favorite
                    topics were creating our own Makefiles, using Linux on a
                    virtual machine, debugging using gdb, and using vim to edit
                    our Python code. </span

                  This course examines Hispanic culture through short stories,
                  movies, and poems. I hadn't analyzed Spanish literature prior to
                  this course, so <span id="dots8">...</span

                    literature reader, those Borges pieces are tough to
                    understand! The literature and cinema chosen for this course
                    were very oriented towards major social issues in Hispanic
                    culture, including historical Bolivian protests, the Mexican
                    Movement of 1968 for education rights, and the separation of
                    social classes. </span

                  This was probably the easiest Spanish course I have taken. This
                  class introduced the issues of translating Spanish to English
                  and vice versa, for example, <span id="dots9">...</span
                  ><span class="more" id="more9">
                    some words in English don't exist in Spanish or sometimes the
                    tone that the author is trying to convey gets mistranslated.
                    Since we were primarily translating Spanish to English, the
                    majority of the spoken communication was done in English
                    (which isn't great for someone trying to improve their Spanish
                    speaking skills). However, I did become a better translator by
                    the end of the course. </span

                    operators like adders, muxes, wires, and ROM. This is an
                    important class because software need to communicate with

                  Prior to this course, I had heard it would be a lot like EECS
                  203, just way harder. Like 203, I expected
                  <span id="dots12">...</span
                  ><span class="more" id="more12">
                    the applications of this course to not be very applicable
                    towards coding/programming. Today, I'm still wondering if this
                    is true. There are a few overlaps between the two courses,
                    such as writing proofs, Fermat's Little Theorem, and working
                    with probability. However, this course focuses on proof-based
                    analysis for numerous languages, different ways to
                    analyze/classify languages and algorithms. This course
                    comprises of topics like Turing machines, identifying
                    languages in P, NP, coNP, ZPP, BPP, RP...(yeah, they could
                    work on cooler acronyms), randomness, and cryptography. For
                    me, this course was a drag because it would seem like the
                    things we learned in lecture were not directly related to the
                    things we were asked to do on the weekly homeworks. In
                    addition, for me, it was a lot harder than 203 simply because
                    there's a lot less math and a lot more proof-writing. On a
                    positive note, one thing I did like was the randomness unit
                    because that unveiled a new way of solving problems
                    efficiently that I had not concerned before. </span

                    in modern America where latinos are increasingly frowned-upon.

                    instance, the Terminator's famous quote "Hasta la vista, baby"

                    environment. In terms of the course material, I thought I was
                    very fortunate to have seen/used all of the material taught
                    from
                    <a href="https://jonathanchuang.me/blog"
                      >my summer internship</a
                    >. If I hadn't, I think this course would've been 3x harder to
                    learn all the material, such as full-stack development, HTTP,
                    the dark web, and Blockchain, at such a fast pace. So prior to
                    taking this course, I definitely recommend playing around with
                    HTML/CSS/JS/React/Flask. </span

                  This was my favorite course this semester. I've been really
                  enjoying web development and this course taught me a lot about
                  human-centered design<span id="dots20">...</span
                  ><span class="more" id="more20"
                    >. Now when I'm designing websites, I always consider "Know
                    thy user, for you are not thy user". Moreover, this course
                    covers basic HTML/CSS/JS,
                    <a href="https://jquery.com/" target="_blank">jQuery</a>,
                    <a href="https://vuejs.org/" target="_blank">Vue.js</a>, and
                    so many techniques/concepts of designing for your target
                    audience. Finally, my group and I were able to create a really
                    cool final project. Check it out

                  This course was very similiar to SPANISH 280. We watched
                  contemporary Latinx films and studied literature<span

                  ><span class="more" id="more21"

                    in-person because Zoom breakout rooms for discussion are not
                    the best. Althought I don't feel like I improved my Spanish
                    skills that much this semester, I really enjoyed some of the
                    films that we watched for this class. An interesting film to
                    watch if you're ever bored: "La piel que habito" by Pedro
                    Almodóvar. </span

                  To be fair, I think this would be an amazing class if it were
                  in-person, but the virtual version was just so poorly
                  handled<span id="dots22">...</span
                  ><span class="more" id="more22"
                    >. For starters, we had 2 take-home lab assignments every week
                    and each lab would have numerous grammar mistakes (shoutout to
                    <a href="https://www.grammarly.com/" target="_blank"
                      >Grammarly</a
                    >). While that already made some of the lab instructions
                    confusing, the instructions themselves would be unclear and I
                    would have to spend a lot of time googling to figure out how
                    to do the lab correctly. Although it is an easy course, I wish
                    I could've taken it in-person to learn the material better and
                    actually know how to do the labs. </span

                  I switched into this class a few weeks into the semester and it
                  did not disappoint. Men's healthcare is a subject that isn't
                  talked about enough<span id="dots23">...</span
                  ><span class="more" id="more23">
                    and this class definitely alleviated some stigmas I had about
                    men's health. Overall, the workload was pretty light - weekly
                    discussion posts, 3 essays, and a take-home exam. More
                    importantly, the overarching themes of this course are
                    important and relevant - we covered economical/racial/gender
                    disparities in the American healthcare system, during
                    COVID-19, and diseases in general. The only reason why I gave
                    this class a 9 instead of a 10 is because there were so many
                    readings each week and I'm not about that life. </span

                  After feeling burnout from Zoom university the previous
                  semester, I sought out a
                  <a href="https://jonathanchuang.me/blog">winter internship</a>
                  while taking <i>only</i> the hardest EECS course<span
                    id="dots24"
                    >...</span
                  ><span class="more" id="more24"
                    >. This was easily the hardest EECS course I've taken and also
                    the most time-consuming. The course consisted of 4 projects:
                    disk I/O scheduler simulator, implementing a mock thread
                    library, pager simulator, and a mock network file server. This
                    course essentially felt like another part-time job. On the
                    bright side, I did learn a lot about operating systems in this
                    course and would recommend this course given you're taking 2-4
                    super easy courses along with this one. </span
