            <h3 id="intro">Week 1 - First Impressions</h3>
            <p>
              I landed an internship at LeaseMagnets after a panicky month-long
              scramble for another internship after my original internship was
              cancelled due to COVID-19. Luckily, I discovered the Digital
              Summer Clinic created by
              <a target="_blank" href="https://annarborusa.org/"
                >Ann Arbor SPARK</a
              >. After the interview with SPARK, there was a matching process
              for all the interviewees and local startups looking for interns.
              Incredibly, I was matched with LeaseMagnets - a virtual leasing
              consultant for apartment websites. I say incredibly because,
              coincidentally, both the co-founders were also current Michigan
              undergraduates and I already knew the CEO from a few classes we've
              had together. I have even eaten with him a few times at the dining
              hall!<br /><br />After reaching out to the LeaseMagnets
              co-founders, I agreed to immediately start working on a project
              before the official start of the digital clinic. For me, this
              summer is about learning the most I can and getting hands-on
              experience has always been the best way for me to learn. I've been
              working on email integration for their
              <a target="_blank" href="https://leasemagnets.com">video tours</a
              >, so when potential customers finish the tour on our clients'
              sites, an email is immediately sent to the clients' leasing team
              about a new lead.

            <h3>Week 2 - Beyond Work</h3>
            <p>
              In the digital summer clinic, we are limited to 10 hours/week of
              pay but I have decided that to get the most software development
              experience I can, to learn new digital marketing/business skills
              the most I can, working 30-35 hour weeks would allow me to achieve
              these goals.<br /><br />This being said, I've discovered that the
              flexibility in my work schedule along with a 5-10 hour decrease
              from a traditional work week has been ideal. In contrast to my
              full-time research position last summer, I've found myself more
              productive and more energetic when I am working. I'm beginning
              work at the same time as last year, but I am working out in the
              afternoons and working a few hours in the evenings/weekends. The
              most drastic difference has been my energy levels during and after
              work. Last summer, I would be so tired after working 8 hours
              straight that I didn't have the energy to exercise or just hangout
              with my friends at times.<br /><br />This work-life balance is
              definitely a priority in my future job hunts. As a software
              developer, I am always looking to be able to achieve more with
              less code - the traditional work week should be thinking the same
              way too.

              Week 3 - How I'm
              <a target="_blank" href="https://reactjs.org/">'React'</a>ing to
              my Work
            </h3>
            <p>
              My first project was creating email templates & email
              functionality using HTML, Python (<a
                target="_blank"
                href="https://pythonhosted.org/Flask-Mail/"
                >flask-mail</a
              >), and <a target="_blank" href="https://zapier.com/">Zapier</a>.
              The purpose of these emails was to create a personalized message
              for when our video tour widget generated a new lead, a client
              requested a promo code, a client scheduled a tour, or a monthly
              performance report of our services for our clients. This was an
              excellent way for me to start my LeaseMagnets internship with
              something I was familiar with (HTML & Python) before learning a
              completely new language. I finished creating the email templates
              during my second week and finally used post requests on Zapier to
              integrate the emailing system.<br /><br />
              My current project and big challenge as been creating a leads
              table for our web dashboard using HTML/CSS and
              <a target="_blank" href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>. To
              start, I created a super basic leads table by adapting a
              <a
                target="_blank"
                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQAHSlTtcmY&t=286s"
                >YouTube tutorial for building a todo list.</a
              >
              After getting familiar with react terminology (props, components,
              methods, etc), I began to build the leads table for the dashboard
              using
              <a target="_blank" href="https://preview.tabler.io/index.html"
                >Tabler</a
              >,

                >Material Table</a
              >, and
              <a target="_blank" href="https://material-ui.com"> Material-UI</a>
              packages. And boy, am I struggling. My biggest challenge has been
              figuring out how to customize the packages' components and provide
              the functionality (filtering, sorting, etc) that I want for the
              table.<br /><br />
              Hopefully only a few more <strike>hours</strike> days of Googling,
              StackExchange, GitHub repo issues hunting, and debugging will do
              the trick...

                  After someone completes our TourMagnet on an apartment's site,
                  we send an email notifying the apartment that they have a new
                  lead, along with the lead's information from the video tour.

                  When someone finished the TourMagnet, they are given a
                  discount on one of the apartment's fees. Thus, this email is
                  sent to the lead to given them the promo code. (Featured:

                  While most apartments mainly only use their existing CRM, we
                  want to give apartment owners and their team the possibility
                  of a more detailed table about the leads generated through our
                  Magnets.

                  Thus far, we have been creating our TourMagnets (video tour)
                  manually (client sends us videos, we make everything).
                  However, we have been working on a dashboard in order to let
                  the customer create everything and have full control over
                  their TourMagnet. This upload page is the first step towards
                  this creation process.

                  Throwback to my first project! For my first emailing project,
                  I had to manually customize each company's emails. Now, we
                  want the client to be able to have full control over the email
                  styling & content via their dashboard.

                      new right after. Now, if I'm struggling on something, I
                      can take a break from that, work on a different component,

            <h3>Week 6 - Personal Projects</h3>
            <p>
              One of the necessities I discussed last week was having time for
              personal projects. The great thing with this internship has been
              that not only do I have time to work on my personal projects, but
              I also have been applying the skills (mainly React) that I have
              been learning & using everyday at work into my own projects!<br /><br />
              My first ever published project is my
              <a
                href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/quicklinks/pmmebpkgkcjmdacahjaomedifklninbp?utm_source=chrome-ntp-icon"
                target="
											"
                >Chrome extension, QuickLinks.</a
              >
              This extension allows quick access/copy to my most used links
              which saves me so much time when I'm applying to jobs because they
              always ask for my LinkedIn & GitHub profiles. Now this project was
              something I had in mind since the beginning of the summer, but the
              first version I made was super ugly and only I could use it. Now
              <a
                href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/quicklinks/pmmebpkgkcjmdacahjaomedifklninbp?utm_source=chrome-ntp-icon"

                >anyone can use it</a
              >
              and it looks pretty decent!<br /><br />
              Other projects that I am currently working on are a new website
              for my club Hoops for Hope and a website for Volunteer Tutoring
              who is attempting to alleviate some of the stress young kids will
              have due to virtual learning by matching them to volunteer tutors.
              Learning React has really opened up the world for me, I'm excited
              for what's next.

            <h3>Week 7 - Finding My Voice</h3>
            <p>
              I've always been an introvert. In any class, even in virtual
              classes, when it's going to be my turn to speak next, I begin to
              feel nervous as my heart starts racing. I've never been one to
              raise my hand in class, nor one to speak up. But I have been
              working on this... One of my goals in life is to be a leader and
              to become a good public speaker; I will never consider myself to
              be a natural-born leader, but I know if I work hard enough, I can
              be a great leader.<br /><br />
              This being said, this internship has helped me find my voice.
              While I am nowhere near where I want to be as a public speaker & a
              leader, LeaseMagnets is a place where I know my voice will be
              heard and valued. My coworker Brandon once said in a meeting that
              I am silent but deadly when I do speak up and voice my ideas. I
              took that to heart and began to express my opinions more often and
              even take the lead on a few things.
              <br /><br />
              Before, like in class, I would be afraid to raise my hand because
              I have a fear of being wrong. However, that is just a facet of
              life. Now, I want to be heard. I have lots of great ideas, the
              world could use my voice. I'm ready for my next challenge to
              become a better leader & public speaker.

              As my internship comes to an end, I feel bittersweet. This
              internship has given me so much...but all good things come to an
              end. Upon reflection, there are 4 major aspects from this
              internship that I am extremely grateful for.
            </p>
            <h4>1. New Knowledge</h4>
            <p>
              Just from learning React, my programming skills grew
              exponentially. In addition, I got to experience a new Python
              package (Flask) this summer with my first emailing project. I now
              have a great foundation in web development & am working on some
              new personal projects ;)!<br /><br/ > Beyond programming, I
              learned so much about digital marketing & entrepreneurship from my
              co-workers and, especially, the CEO & fellow Umich undergrad
              Amulya.
            </p>
            <h4>2. Network Growth</h4>
            <p>
              Another thing that grew exponentially this summer was
              <a
                href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/j0nathanchuang/"
                target="_blank"
              >
                my LinkedIn</a
              >
              connections. I was able to make new friends from all of the 47
              other Ann Arbor SPARK interns & my co-workers at LeaseMagnets.
              Moreover, about 70% of the LeaseMagnets team are all Michigan
              undergrads right now, so hopefully, I'll be able to see some more
              familiar Zoom faces on campus. Lastly, SPARK had a panel of
              speakers each Thursday from different professions/backgrounds,
              whom are all excited to help out all of the SPARK interns about
              networking, recruiting, working, etc.
            </p>
            <h4>3. Moving Out of my Comfort Zone</h4>
            <p>
              As mentioned in <a href="#week7">last week's blog</a>, I really
              found more of my voice this summer. I want to be a great leader &
              a great public speaker, and this internship was a great step
              towards that goal. Furthermore, I matured a lot as a programmer
              just from the independence/creative freedom I was given. I love
              collaboration & having someone way smarter than me as in-person
              StackOverflow, but I didn't really get that anchor this summer. I
              had to debug almost everything on my own & go through the hours of
              Googling in hopes of someone having the same error as me and
              posted about it. But now, I am way better at knowing what to
              Google & working alone when necessary.
            </p>
            <h4>4. Learning About Myself</h4>
            <p>
              Before this internship, I had no work experience in the tech
              industry, thus I had no real idea of what it's like working in
              these types of environments. Now I have a better idea. In
              <a href="#5">week 5's blog</a>, I created a table of my likes &
              dislikes for an ideal working environment and I didn't know about
              half of those things about myself until now. Plus, with all the
              knowledge I gained this summer, I found out what this brain of
              mine

            <h3>January 2021 to May 2021 - The Return</h3>
            <p>
              After the fall '20 semester and my first taste of
              <a
                href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/06/zoom-university-college-cost-students-in-person-experience"

              >
                "Zoom University"</a
              >
              , I wanted to take a gap semester and find a winter semester
              internship to gain more work experience. The constant Zooming and
              never-ending screen time became mentally-draining and also, I can
              honestly say I've learned more from my LeaseMagnets summer
              internship than a whole year at college. After weighing all of my
              options, a return to the place where my web development journey
              started made the most sense.
              <br /><br />
              This time around was not without its roadblocks but the great
              things about LeaseMagnets were also still here. I felt like this
              time I had even more responsibility (which I loved) and my
              opinion, whether on design decisions or project ideas, was valued
              even more. Additionally, I enjoyed our monthly chats on what can
              be improved, on my end and also my boss's end. Obviously, I love
              hearing compliments about my work and the things I create, but
              hearing genuine constructive criticism is what will allow me to
              grow.
              <br /><br />
              I won't be including <a href="#week4">screenshots</a> this time,
              but I worked on our dashboard, our videomagnet, and a future
              product called "residents.me". I'm proud to say our products work
              way better and look way better than they did last summer! As I'm
              writing this, as a signoff from another great experience, I'm
              feeling mixed emotions of bittersweetness, joyfulness, and angst
              of what my next internship at
              <a href="https://www.capitalone.com/" target="_blank"
                >Capital One</a
              >
              will be like. If it is even 50% as invaluable as my journey at
              LeaseMagnets, it will be awesome. I leave LeaseMagnets with a
              genuine feeling that I left the place better than when I found it,
              and a sense of real accomplishment. I also leave knowing that I
              became a better web developer but also a person from working here,
              and hope I had the same impact on the people I worked with.
              <br /><br />
              Finally, congratulations to LeaseMagnets for becoming a

                >Y Combinator company</a
