										<h2>Jonathan Chuang's Blog</h2>
										<p>How my internship with <a href="https://leasemagnets.com">LeaseMagnets</a> has gone</p>
									</header>
									<h3 id="week1">Week 1 - First Impressions</h3>
									<p>I landed an internship at LeaseMagnets after a panicky month-long scramble for another internship
									after my original internship was cancelled due to COVID-19. Luckily, I discovered the Digital
								  Summer Clinic created by <a href="https://annarborusa.org/">Ann Arbor SPARK</a>. After the interview with SPARK,
								  there was a matching process for all the interviewees and local startups looking for interns. Incredibly,
									I was matched with LeaseMagnets - a virtual leasing consultant for apartment websites.
									I say incredibly because, coincidentally, both the co-founders were also
									current Michigan undergraduates and I already knew the CEO from a few classes we've had together. I
									have even eaten with him a few times at the dining hall!<br/><br/>After reaching out to the LeaseMagnets
									co-founders, I agreed to immediately start working on a project before the official start of
									the digital clinic. For me, this summer is about learning the most I can and getting hands-on
									experience has always been the best way for me to learn. I've been working on email integration for
									their <a href="https://leasemagnets.com">video tours</a>, so when potential customers finish the tour
									on our clients' sites, an email is immediately sent to the clients' leasing team about a new lead.</p>

									<h3>Week 2 - Beyond Work</h3>
									<p>In the digital summer clinic, we are limited to 10 hours/week of pay but I have
									decided that to get the most software development experience I can,
									to learn new digital marketing/business skills the most I can, working 30-35 hour
								  weeks would allow me to achieve these goals.<br/><br/>This being said, I've discovered
								  that the flexibility in my work schedule along with a 5-10 hour decrease from a traditional
									work week has been ideal. In contrast to my full-time research position last summer,
								  I've found myself more productive and more energetic when I am working. I'm beginning work
								  at the same time as last year, but I am working out in the afternoons and working a few hours
								  in the evenings/weekends. The most drastic difference has been my energy levels during and
								 	after work. Last summer, I would be so tired after working 8 hours straight that I didn't
									have the energy to exercise or just hangout with my friends at times.<br/><br/>This work-life
									balance is definitely a priority in my future job hunts. As a software developer, I am always
									looking to be able to achieve more with less code - the traditional work week should be
									thinking the same way too.</p>

								<div class="container">
									<h3>Week 3 - How I'm <a href="https://reactjs.org/">'React'</a>ing to my Work</h3>
									<p>My first project was creating email templates & email functionality using HTML, Python
										(<a href='https://pythonhosted.org/Flask-Mail/'>flask-mail</a>), and <a href="https://zapier.com/">Zapier</a>.
										The purpose of these emails was to create a personalized message for when our video tour widget
										generated a new lead, a client requested a promo code, a client scheduled a tour,
										or a monthly performance report of our services for our clients.
										This was an excellent way for me to start my LeaseMagnets internship with something I was familiar with
										(HTML & Python) before learning a completely new language. I finished creating the email templates during
										my second week and finally used post requests on Zapier to integrate the emailing system.<br/><br/>
										My current project and big challenge as been creating a leads table for our web dashboard using
										HTML/CSS and <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>. To start, I created a super basic leads table
										by adapting a <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQAHSlTtcmY&t=286s'>YouTube tutorial for
										building a todo list.</a> After getting familiar with react terminology (props, components, methods, etc),
										I began to build the leads table for the dashboard using <a href='https://preview.tabler.io/index.html'>Tabler</a>,
										<a href='https://material-table.com/#/docs/get-started'>Material Table</a>, and <a href='https://material-ui.com'>
										Material-UI</a> packages. And boy, am I struggling. My biggest challenge has been figuring out how to customize
										the packages' components and provide the functionality (filtering, sorting, etc) that I want for the table.<br/><br/>
										Hopefully only a few more <strike>hours</strike> days of Googling, StackExchange, GitHub repo issues hunting, and debugging
										will do the trick...

									<h3>Week 4 - Some Screenshots</h3>
									<p>I'm now about 95% done with the leads table! I've been talking a lot, so I figure for this week, I would
										just show some pictures of the things I've made so far. (I'll be adding to this table in future weeks as well.)</p>

												<p>After someone completes our TourMagnet on an apartment's site, we send
													an email notifying the apartment that they have a new lead, along with the
													lead's information from the video tour.</p>

												<p>When someone finished the TourMagnet, they are given a discount on
														one of the apartment's fees. Thus, this email is sent to the lead
														to given them the promo code. (Featured: Cayce Cove)</p>

												<p>While most apartments mainly only use their existing CRM, we want
														to give apartment owners and their team the possibility of a more detailed table
														about the leads generated through our Magnets.</p>
