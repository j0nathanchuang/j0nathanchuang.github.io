										<h2>Jonathan Chuang's Blog</h2>
										<p>How my internship with <a target="_blank" href="https://leasemagnets.com">LeaseMagnets</a> has gone</p>
									</header>
									<h3 id="week1">Week 1 - First Impressions</h3>
									<p>I landed an internship at LeaseMagnets after a panicky month-long scramble for another internship
									after my original internship was cancelled due to COVID-19. Luckily, I discovered the Digital
								  Summer Clinic created by <a target="_blank" href="https://annarborusa.org/">Ann Arbor SPARK</a>. After the interview with SPARK,
								  there was a matching process for all the interviewees and local startups looking for interns. Incredibly,
									I was matched with LeaseMagnets - a virtual leasing consultant for apartment websites.
									I say incredibly because, coincidentally, both the co-founders were also
									current Michigan undergraduates and I already knew the CEO from a few classes we've had together. I
									have even eaten with him a few times at the dining hall!<br/><br/>After reaching out to the LeaseMagnets
									co-founders, I agreed to immediately start working on a project before the official start of
									the digital clinic. For me, this summer is about learning the most I can and getting hands-on
									experience has always been the best way for me to learn. I've been working on email integration for
									their <a target="_blank" href="https://leasemagnets.com">video tours</a>, so when potential customers finish the tour
									on our clients' sites, an email is immediately sent to the clients' leasing team about a new lead.</p>

									<h3>Week 2 - Beyond Work</h3>
									<p>In the digital summer clinic, we are limited to 10 hours/week of pay but I have
									decided that to get the most software development experience I can,
									to learn new digital marketing/business skills the most I can, working 30-35 hour
								  weeks would allow me to achieve these goals.<br/><br/>This being said, I've discovered
								  that the flexibility in my work schedule along with a 5-10 hour decrease from a traditional
									work week has been ideal. In contrast to my full-time research position last summer,
								  I've found myself more productive and more energetic when I am working. I'm beginning work
								  at the same time as last year, but I am working out in the afternoons and working a few hours
								  in the evenings/weekends. The most drastic difference has been my energy levels during and
								 	after work. Last summer, I would be so tired after working 8 hours straight that I didn't
									have the energy to exercise or just hangout with my friends at times.<br/><br/>This work-life
									balance is definitely a priority in my future job hunts. As a software developer, I am always
									looking to be able to achieve more with less code - the traditional work week should be
									thinking the same way too.</p>

								<div class="container">
									<h3>Week 3 - How I'm <a target="_blank" href="https://reactjs.org/">'React'</a>ing to my Work</h3>
									<p>My first project was creating email templates & email functionality using HTML, Python
										(<a target="_blank" href='https://pythonhosted.org/Flask-Mail/'>flask-mail</a>), and <a target="_blank" href="https://zapier.com/">Zapier</a>.
										The purpose of these emails was to create a personalized message for when our video tour widget
										generated a new lead, a client requested a promo code, a client scheduled a tour,
										or a monthly performance report of our services for our clients.
										This was an excellent way for me to start my LeaseMagnets internship with something I was familiar with
										(HTML & Python) before learning a completely new language. I finished creating the email templates during
										my second week and finally used post requests on Zapier to integrate the emailing system.<br/><br/>
										My current project and big challenge as been creating a leads table for our web dashboard using
										HTML/CSS and <a target="_blank" href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>. To start, I created a super basic leads table
										by adapting a <a target="_blank" href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQAHSlTtcmY&t=286s'>YouTube tutorial for
										building a todo list.</a> After getting familiar with react terminology (props, components, methods, etc),
										I began to build the leads table for the dashboard using <a target="_blank" href='https://preview.tabler.io/index.html'>Tabler</a>,
										<a target="_blank" href='https://material-table.com/#/docs/get-started'>Material Table</a>, and <a target="_blank" href='https://material-ui.com'>
										Material-UI</a> packages. And boy, am I struggling. My biggest challenge has been figuring out how to customize
										the packages' components and provide the functionality (filtering, sorting, etc) that I want for the table.<br/><br/>
										Hopefully only a few more <strike>hours</strike> days of Googling, StackExchange, GitHub repo issues hunting, and debugging
										will do the trick...

									<h3>Week 4 - Some Screenshots</h3>
									<p>I'm now about 95% done with the leads table! I've been talking a lot, so I figure for this week, I would
										just show some pictures of the things I've made so far. (Last Update: 8/13/20)</p>

												<p>Thus far, we have been creating our TourMagnets (video tour) manually
													(client sends us videos, we make everything). However, we have been working
													on a dashboard in order to let the customer create everything and have full
													control over their TourMagnet. This upload page is the first step towards

												<br />
												Throwback to my first project! For my first emailing project, I had to

										<h3>Week 6 - Personal Projects</h3>
										<p>One of the necessities I discussed last week was having time for personal projects.
											 The great thing with this internship has been that not only do I have time to
										 	 work on my personal projects, but I also have been applying the skills (mainly React)
										 	 that I have been learning & using everyday at work into my own projects!<br /><br />
											 My first ever published project is my <a href='https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/quicklinks/pmmebpkgkcjmdacahjaomedifklninbp?utm_source=chrome-ntp-icon' target="
											 ">Chrome extension, QuickLinks.</a> This extension allows quick access/copy to my most used links
											 which saves me so much time when I'm applying to jobs because they always ask for my LinkedIn & GitHub profiles.
											 Now this project was something I had in mind since the beginning of the summer, but the first version I made
											 was super ugly and only I could use it. Now <a href='https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/quicklinks/pmmebpkgkcjmdacahjaomedifklninbp?utm_source=chrome-ntp-icon' target="
											 ">anyone can use it</a> and it looks pretty decent!<br /><br />
											 Other projects that I am currently working on are a new website for my club Hoops for Hope and a website
											 for Volunteer Tutoring who is attempting to alleviate some of the stress young kids will have due to virtual learning by
											 matching them to volunteer tutors. Learning React has really opened up the world for me, I'm excited for what's next.

											<h3>Week 7 - Finding My Voice</h3>
											<p>
												I've always been an introvert. In any class, even in virtual classes,
												when it's going to be my turn to speak next, I begin to feel nervous as
												my heart starts racing. I've never been one to raise my hand in class,
												nor one to speak up. But I have been working on this... One of my goals
												in life is to be a leader and to become a good public speaker; I will
												never consider myself to be a natural-born leader, but I know if I
												work hard enough, I can be a great leader.<br /><br />
												This being said, this internship has helped me find my voice. While I
												am nowhere near where I want to be as a public speaker & a leader,
												LeaseMagnets is a place where I know my voice will be heard and valued.
												My coworker Brandon once said in a meeting that I am silent but deadly
												when I do speak up and voice my ideas. I took that to heart and began
												to express my opinions more often and even take the lead on a few things.
												<br /><br />
												Before, like in class, I would be afraid to raise my hand because I have a
												fear of being wrong. However, that is just a facet of life. Now, I want to
												be heard. I have lots of great ideas, the world could use my voice. I'm
												ready for my next challenge to become a better leader & public speaker.
