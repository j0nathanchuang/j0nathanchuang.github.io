              I am a software engineer at
              <a target="_blank" href="https://www.getmagical.com/">Magical</a>.
              I graduated with a B.S. degree in computer
              science and a Spanish minor from the University of Michigan in
              2022. My technical interests include UI/UX design, sports
              analytics, VR, and human-centered software. I like to apply my
              technical skills and diverse cultural knowledge towards making
              daily functions easier and people's lives better. For hobbies, I
              love playing almost all active sports, especially basketball &
              tennis, listening to
              <a href="https://jonathanchuang.me/spotify">music</a>
              and, cooking (hopefully I'll be as skilled as my mom one day).

                    After working at a start-up, I really wanted to work at an
                    established tech company to experience the other end of the
                    spectrum. I definitely got that at Capital One. I worked in
                    an agile work environment using a

                    with our manager. I worked in an intern pod with 3 other
                    interns and got to and work with the full-time employees
                    every day. I even got to experience a beta launch of the
                    internal credit card policy builder tool I was working on!
                    Throughout my internship, I received numerous swag bags,
                    snack boxes, and GrubHub gift cards. I also had the
                    opportunity to interact with the CEO! Not many internship
                    experiences can say that. Additionally, everyone that I ever
                    talked to at Capital One felt like a genuine, friendly
                    person that I would enjoy working with full-time. Capital
                    One truly puts its employees first and has mastered
                    work-life balance in the pandemic. To see what I got to work

                    I joined this club my freshman year simply because I love
                    basketball and wanted to volunteer in the community.
                    Throughout semesters of hosting basketball clinics for the
                    elementary school kids at Central Academy, I realized that
                    this club is more about mentorship and the sense of
                    community for these kids than it is about basketball. As the
                    media chair, I created the club's
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://michiganhoopsforhope.com/"
                      >website</a
                    >
                    and handle the club's social media pages on Instagram and
                    LinkedIn. But more importantly, as a mentor, I've built
                    lasting relationships with these young kids and, hopefully,
                    ingrained the importance of exercising instead of making
                    TikToks.

                Everyone should absolutely take this class. This course was my
                first exposure to coding and also, it was the course that
                convinced me to be a computer science major<span id="dots1"
                  >...</span
                ><span class="more" id="more1"
                  >. Now, I am not saying that it will have the same effect on
                  you too, however, I am saying that coding and understanding
                  the basics of computer science will play a huge role in the
                  near future, regardless of your occupation. If you do not have
                  coding experience prior to college, like me, you will probably
                  find this course to be a challenging and time consuming
                  course. But utlimately, I found that these challenges and the
                  way coding taught me a new way of thinking is what I like so
                  much about computer science. Hopefully, you will too. </span

                Personally, I thought this was a much more difficult course than
                advertised because the professor's teaching style did not match
                my learning style <span id="dots2">...</span
                ><span class="more" id="more2"
                  >. Throughout the course, it was apparent that my professor
                  was a brilliant researcher and knew R extremely well, however,
                  I had difficulty understanding her lectures because she would
                  blindly lecture without checking for student understanding or
                  go through practice examples together in class. I found going
                  to GSI office hours very helpful to get a more detailed
                  understanding of the material and to finish the homeworks
                  correctly. On a positive note, I learned R in this course and
                  decided not to be a statistics major. </span

                The first-year writing requirement has a wide variety of topics

                  "Speaking Math" section of 125 focuses on how publication
                  incorporate and manipulate statistics to convey the message
                  they want. Almost always, the statistics are factual, however,
                  it's important to ask yourself how they got these statistics
                  and from who & how the portrayal of numbers could lead to a
                  different reaction if they were shown in a different form (i.e
                  90% are good vs. 10% are bad). </span

                I really wish I had taken this course further into my college
                career. This was a fun course where
                <span id="dots4">...</span
                ><span class="more" id="more4">
                  everyone was split into small groups (4-6) and each group had
                  half-a-semester to turn an idea into reality on an issue
                  that's important to the group members. Our group ended up
                  creating a project that matched people who were looking for
                  workout partners to promote exercise because we all believed
                  that people have a tendency to remove exercise from their
                  schedules when their work schedule gets busy. The struggle is
                  real. As someone who skips leg day every now and then, I know
                  if I had a workout partner every time I went to the gym, I
                  would feel motivated and obligated to do every leg day. As I
                  said, I wish I had taken this course later because now I have
                  much more ideas and a wider skillset to transform my ideas
                  into real solutions. </span

                  it also strengthen my ability to collaborate with another

                  queues & algorithms I did not know could exist like dynamic
                  programming, branch and bound, new sorting algorithms,

                I registered for this class because of a friend's recommendation
                and it did not disappoint. I believe this should be a required
                course for anyone who is a CS major<span id="dots7">...</span
                ><span class="more" id="more7"
                  >. In short, this class provides a brief overview of a new,
                  relevant topic every week through only one lecture and one
                  homework each week. In my prior EECS courses, they provide us
                  with the tools and tell us how to use it for our specific
                  purposes. For example, for projects, I would get
                  instructor-made Makefiles and all I had to do was to type
                  "make project" in terminal and "magic" would happen. However,
                  EECS 201 dives into what these tools are, how we can build our
                  own tools, and why these tools are used. Some of my favorite
                  topics were creating our own Makefiles, using Linux on a
                  virtual machine, debugging using gdb, and using vim to edit
                  our Python code. </span

                Credits: 3<br />
                This was probably the easiest Spanish course I have taken. This
                class introduced the issues of translating Spanish to English
                and vice versa, for example, <span id="dots9">...</span
                ><span class="more" id="more9">
                  some words in English don't exist in Spanish or sometimes the
                  tone that the author is trying to convey gets mistranslated.
                  Since we were primarily translating Spanish to English, the
                  majority of the spoken communication was done in English
                  (which isn't great for someone trying to improve their Spanish
                  speaking skills). However, I did become a better translator by
                  the end of the course. </span

                  towards coding/programming. Today, I'm still wondering if this
                  is true. There are a few overlaps between the two courses,
                  such as writing proofs, Fermat's Little Theorem, and working
                  with probability. However, this course focuses on proof-based
                  analysis for numerous languages, different ways to
                  analyze/classify languages and algorithms. This course
                  comprises of topics like Turing machines, identifying
                  languages in P, NP, coNP, ZPP, BPP, RP...(yeah, they could
                  work on cooler acronyms), randomness, and cryptography. For
                  me, this course was a drag because it would seem like the
                  things we learned in lecture were not directly related to the
                  things we were asked to do on the weekly homeworks. In
                  addition, for me, it was a lot harder than 203 simply because
                  there's a lot less math and a lot more proof-writing. On a
                  positive note, one thing I did like was the randomness unit
                  because that unveiled a new way of solving problems
                  efficiently that I had not concerned before. </span

                  others for not being able to change their mind, we need to
                  change our own mindset to discover the truth and update our
                  viewpoint when given evidence, even if it's evidence for the

                This is a project-based course that focuses on Mock Spanish.
                Mock Spanish is the use of

                  stereotypes of Hispanic culture or stereotypes of the use of
                  Spanish. Mock Spanish is a prevelant issue today, especially
                  in modern America where latinos are increasingly frowned-upon.
                  We can see examples of mock Spanish in pop culture, for
                  instance, the Terminator's famous quote "Hasta la vista, baby"
                  or even in everyday conversation, "no problemo". My group and

                Although this was a really hard course, I liked the format
                Professor DeOrio chose to teach this virtual course<span
                  id="dots19"
                  >...</span
                ><span class="more" id="more19"
                  >. Each lecture was broken down into 4-5 10-20 minute videos
                  that allowed me to watch one part, take a break or do
                  something else, and come back to lecture later easily.
                  Boredom/lack of focus was something that a lot of my other
                  courses failed to account for given the virtual learning
                  environment. In terms of the course material, I thought I was
                  very fortunate to have seen/used all of the material taught
                  from
                  <a href="https://jonathanchuang.me/blog"
                    >my summer internship</a
                  >. If I hadn't, I think this course would've been 3x harder to
                  learn all the material, such as full-stack development, HTTP,
                  the dark web, and Blockchain, at such a fast pace. So prior to
                  taking this course, I definitely recommend playing around with
                  HTML/CSS/JS/React/Flask. </span

                  thy user, for you are not thy user". Moreover, this course
                  covers basic HTML/CSS/JS,

                  would have to spend a lot of time googling to figure out how

                  and this class definitely alleviated some stigmas I had about
                  men's health. Overall, the workload was pretty light - weekly
                  discussion posts, 3 essays, and a take-home exam. More
                  importantly, the overarching themes of this course are
                  important and relevant - we covered economical/racial/gender
                  disparities in the American healthcare system, during
                  COVID-19, and diseases in general. The only reason why I gave
                  this class a 9 instead of a 10 is because there were so many
                  readings each week and I'm not about that life. </span

                Credits: 6<br />
                After feeling burnout from Zoom university the previous
                semester, I sought out a
                <a href="https://jonathanchuang.me/blog">winter internship</a>
                while taking <i>only</i> the hardest EECS course<span
                  id="dots24"
                  >...</span
                ><span class="more" id="more24"
                  >. This was easily the hardest EECS course I've taken and also
                  the most time-consuming. The course consisted of 4 projects:
                  disk I/O scheduler simulator, implementing a mock thread
                  library, pager simulator, and a mock network file server. This
                  course essentially felt like another part-time job. On the
                  bright side, I did learn a lot about operating systems in this
                  course and would recommend this course given you're taking 2-4
                  super easy courses along with this one. </span
