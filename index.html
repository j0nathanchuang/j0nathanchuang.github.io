										<h5><a target="_blank" href="https://atlas.ai.umich.edu/course/EECS%20183/" class="button alt">EECS 183</a> - Elementary Programming Concepts</h5>
										<p> Credits: 4</br>
										 Everyone should absolutely take this class. This course was my first exposure to coding and also, it was the course
										 that convinced me to be a computer science major<span id="dots1">...</span><span class="more" id="more1">.
										 Now, I am not saying that it will have the same effect on you too, however,
										 I am saying that coding and understanding the basics of computer science will play a huge role in the near future, regardless
										 of your occupation. If you do not have coding experience prior to college, like me, you will probably find this course to be
									   a challenging and time consuming course. But utlimately, I found that these challenges and the way coding taught me a new
									   way of thinking is what I like so much about computer science. Hopefully, you will too.

										<h5><a target="_blank" href="https://atlas.ai.umich.edu/course/STATS%20280/" class="button alt">STATS 280</a> - Honors Introduction to Statistics and Data Analysis</h5>
										<p> Credits: 4</br>
										    Personally, I thought this was a much more difficult course than advertised because the professor's teaching style did not
												match my learning style <span id="dots2">...</span><span class="more" id="more2">.
											  Throughout the course, it was apparent that my professor was a brilliant researcher and knew R extremely well, however,
											 	I had difficulty understanding her lectures because she would blindly lecture without checking for student understanding
											  or go through practice examples together in class. I found going to GSI office hours very helpful to get a more detailed understanding
											  of the material and to finish the homeworks correctly. On a positive note, I learned R in this course and decided not to be a
											  statistics major. </span><button class="button primary" onclick="readMore(2)" id="myBtn2">Read more</button></br></br>
										    Recommendation: 6/10</p>
										<h5><a target="_blank" href="https://atlas.ai.umich.edu/course/ENGLISH%20125/" class="button alt">ENGLISH 125</a> - Speaking Math</h5>
										<p> Credits: 4</br>
												The first-year writing requirement has a wide variety of topics to choose from and I picked "Speaking Math"
												<span id="dots3">...</span><span class="more" id="more3">because
											  in high school I was always much better at math than writing so I figured a combination of the two could help me become
											  a better writer. I like to think I was right. The "Speaking Math" section of 125 focuses on how publication incorporate
											  and manipulate statistics to convey the message they want. Almost always, the statistics are factual, however, it's important
											  to ask yourself how they got these statistics and from who & how the portrayal of numbers could lead to a different reaction
											  if they were shown in a different form (i.e 90% are good vs. 10% are bad).

										<h5><a target="_blank" href="https://atlas.ai.umich.edu/course/SPANISH%20277/" class="button alt">SPANISH 277</a> - Spanish Grammar and Composition</h5>
										<p> Credits: 3</br>
												This class was a good refresher of lots of Spanish grammar rules as well as most of the verb forms. If you took AP Spanish in
												high school, this course will be a nice review before going into harder Spanish courses.</br></br>
										  	Recommendation: 8/10</p>
										<h5><a target="_blank" href="https://atlas.ai.umich.edu/course/ALA%20170/" class="button alt">ALA 170</a> - BLI Leadership Lab</h5>
										<p> Credits: 1</br>
												I really wish I had taken this course further into my college career. This was a fun course where
												<span id="dots4">...</span><span class="more" id="more4">	everyone was split
												into small groups (4-6) and each group had half-a-semester to turn an idea into reality	on an issue that's important to the group
												members. Our group ended up creating a project that matched people who were looking for workout partners to promote exercise
												because we all believed that people have a tendency to remove exercise from their schedules when their work schedule gets busy.
												The struggle is real. As someone who skips leg day every now and then, I know if I had a workout partner every time I went
												to the gym, I would feel motivated and obligated to do every leg day. As I said, I wish I had taken this course later because
												now I have much more ideas and a wider skillset to transform my ideas into real solutions.

												the four pillars of object-oriented programming and <span id="dots5">...</span><span class="more" id="more5">
												simply tools to write code efficiently, like overloading operators to simplify your code. This is the course with the notoriously

										<p> Credits: 4</br>
												This course introduced me to proof-based analysis. To this day, I am still questioning
												<span id="dots16">...</span><span class="more" id="more16">how some of the topics covered
												will be of any use in my career as a computer scientist. However, many of these concepts were helpful in EECS 281 and EECS 376.

										<p> Credits: 3</br>
												This class is easily my favorite Spanish class. In this course, we explore Latin American culture through watching Hispanic TV shows
												and movies. Professor Noverr <span id="dots17">...</span><span class="more" id="more17">has a tendency to pick great shows/movies.
												Prior to this course, I hadn't really watched any Spanish

										<p> Credits: 4</br>
												This intro course covered a broad spectrum of topics to get you interested in taking more detailed,
												upper-level psych classes. The workload <span id="dots18">...</span><span class="more" id="more18">and

										<p> Credits: 4</br>
											The rumors are true - this is a hard course. Easily the hardest course I had taken up to this point, but also
											the most rewarding. This class will forever own hundreds of hours of my life <span id="dots6">...</span><span class="more" id="more6">
											towards testing and debugging but it also advanced my knowledge and

											dynamic programming, branch and bound, new sorting algorithms, depth-first search, and breadth-first search.

											I registered for this class because of a friend's recommendation and it did not disappoint. I believe this should be
											a required course for anyone who is a CS major<span id="dots7">...</span><span class="more" id="more7">.
											In short, this class provides	a brief overview of a new, relevant
											topic every week through only one lecture and one homework each week. In my prior EECS courses, they provide us with the tools
											and tell us how to use it for our specific purposes. For example, for projects, I would get instructor-made Makefiles and
											all I had to do was to type "make project" in terminal and "magic" would happen. However, EECS 201 dives into what these tools
											are, how we can build our own tools, and why these tools are used. Some of my favorite topics were creating our own Makefiles,
											using Linux on a virtual machine, debugging using gdb, and using vim to edit our Python code.

										<p> Credits: 3</br>
												This course examines Hispanic culture through short stories, movies, and poems. I hadn't analyzed Spanish literature prior
												to this course, so <span id="dots8">...</span><span class="more" id="more8">that was an intriguing new challenge for me.
												For any Spanish literature reader, those Borges pieces
												are tough to understand! The literature and cinema chosen for this course were very oriented towards major social issues
												in Hispanic culture, including historical Bolivian protests, the Mexican Movement of 1968 for education rights, and the separation
												of social classes. </span><button class="button primary" onclick="readMore(8)" id="myBtn8">Read more</button></br></br>

										<h5><a target="_blank" href="https://atlas.ai.umich.edu/course/SPANISH%20289/" class="button alt">SPANISH 289</a> - Introduction to Translation</h5>
										<p> Credits: 3</br>
												This was probably the easiest Spanish course I have taken. This class introduced the issues of translating Spanish to
												English and vice versa, for example, <span id="dots9">...</span><span class="more" id="more9">
												some words in English don't exist in Spanish or sometimes the tone that the author is trying
												to convey gets mistranslated. Since we were primarily translating Spanish to English, the majority of the
												spoken communication was done in English (which isn't great for someone trying to improve their Spanish speaking skills).
												However, I did become a better translator by the end of the course. </span><button class="button primary" onclick="readMore(9)" id="myBtn9">Read more</button></br></br>

												I took this class for my upper-level writing requirement. Lectures covered important issues, such as global warming,
												environmental racism, <span id="dots10">...</span><span class="more" id="more10">and modernization, with a concentration of
												how these issues impact Africa. I enjoyed learning
												about these topics because they're not covered in a typical computer science course. Plus, learning about

												This course focuses on computer architecture. This is an important course for all computer scientists because
												<span id="dots11">...</span><span class="more" id="more11">it taught me
												how information travels in the hardware as well as why the order in which you declare variables can cause the software to run

										<p> Credits: 4</br>
											Prior to this course, I had heard it would be a lot like EECS 203, just way harder.
											Like 203, I expected <span id="dots12">...</span><span class="more" id="more12">
											the applications of this course to not be very applicable towards coding/programming. Today,
											I'm still wondering if this is true. There are a few overlaps between the two courses, such as writing proofs,
											Fermat's Little Theorem, and working with probability.
											However, this course focuses on proof-based analysis for numerous languages, different
											ways to analyze/classify languages and algorithms. This course comprises of topics like Turing machines, identifying languages in P,
											NP, coNP, ZPP, BPP, RP...(yeah, they could work on cooler acronyms), randomness, and cryptography. For me, this course was
											a drag because it would seem like the things we learned in lecture were not directly related to the things we were asked
											to do on the weekly homeworks. In addition, for me, it was a lot harder than 203 simply because there's a lot less
											math and a lot more proof-writing.
											On a positive note, one thing I did like was the randomness unit because that unveiled a new way of solving problems
											efficiently that I had not concerned before. </span><button class="button primary" onclick="readMore(12)" id="myBtn12">Read more</button></br></br>

										<h5><a target="_blank" href="https://atlas.ai.umich.edu/course/PHIL%20183/" class="button alt">PHIL 183</a> - Critical Reasoning</h5>
										<p> Credits: 3</br>
												Are you tired of arguing with people who never change their minds? Turns out it's a "you" problem. I believe
												this is a critical class that everyone should take, especially <span id="dots13">...</span><span class="more" id="more13">
												politicians. In this course, we learn about the many
												biases that cloud our judgement and decision-making. Before we blame others for not being able to change their mind,
												we need to change our own mindset to discover the truth and update our viewpoint when given evidence,
												even if it's evidence for the opposing argument. This course provides the tools to do so - to critically reason.

										<h5><a target="_blank" href="https://atlas.ai.umich.edu/course/SPANISH%20487/" class="button alt">SPANISH 487</a> - Studies in Hispanic Linguistics</h5>
										<p> Credits: 3</br>
												This is a project-based course that focuses on Mock Spanish. Mock Spanish is the use of
												<span id="dots14">...</span><span class="more" id="more14"> real Spanish words or
												made-up Spanish words to index stereotypes of Hispanic culture or stereotypes of the use of Spanish. Mock Spanish
												is a prevelant issue today, especially in modern America where latinos are increasingly frowned-upon. We can see
												examples of mock Spanish in pop culture, for instance, the Terminator's famous quote "Hasta la vista, baby" or even
												in everyday conversation, "no problemo". My group and I wrote a research paper on the use of Spanish in Ann Arbor restaurants,
											 	you can read it <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YR48trA6bJTk2oBE1t4XoSvBd98NObJe0cJb5Bcobhw/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.

										<p> Credits: 3</br>
												As a child, I thought rocket science was a hoax because of the popular saying. As a result,
												<span id="dots15">...</span><span class="more" id="more15">I knew I had to
												take this course to see what it's really all about. Turns out the popular saying is correct, rocket science
												is pretty hard. Luckily, this is just an intro course that covers the basics of rockets, rocket history, and
												outer space. It's a pretty interesting course and now I can say "it's not rocket science" knowing that
												it's a real thing. </span><button class="button primary" onclick="readMore(15)" id="myBtn15">Read more</button></br></br>
